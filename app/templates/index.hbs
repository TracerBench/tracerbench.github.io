      <h4>As it pertains to data analysis intuition leads us astray</h4>
      <p>
        We see patterns in random data and jump
        to unwarranted conclusions. We need a guide. One that uses statistical rigor so that we can make valid
        conclusions
        based upon the data. <i>TracerBench aims to be that guide.</i>
